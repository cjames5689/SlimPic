Instructions:
To get the work order's specific directory path:
1. Open Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to the folder with the current work order's photos
3. Click the address bar to highlight the path
4. Copy the path and paste it into this program

Note: 
*SlimPic is a tool designed to reduce the file size of your .jpeg images by fitting them within a maximum 
bounding box of 1600x1200 pixels. The program preserves the original aspect ratio of your photos, ensuring they are 
resized based on their orientationâ€”whether portrait or landscape. If the photos to be processed are already within
the bounding box resolution, they will be saved in the resized folder, but remain the original size.
