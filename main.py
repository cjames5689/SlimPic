Instructions:
To get the work order's specific directory path:
1. Open Windows Explorer
2. Navigate to the folder with the current work order's photos
3. You can either:
   - Click the address bar to highlight the path, then copy and paste it into this program
   - Or simply drag and drop the folder into this program window to automatically add the directory path.

Note: 
*SlimPic is a tool designed to reduce the file size of your .jpeg images by fitting them within a maximum 
bounding box of 1600x1200 pixels. The program preserves the original aspect ratio of your photos, ensuring they are 
resized based on their orientationâ€”whether portrait or landscape. If the photos to be processed are already within
the bounding box resolution, they will be saved in the resized folder, but remain the original size.
