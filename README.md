OVERVIEW:

*SlimPic is a tool designed to reduce the file size of your .jpeg images by fitting them within a maximum 
bounding box of 1600x1200 pixels. The program preserves the original aspect ratio of your photos, ensuring they are 
resized based on their orientationâ€”whether portrait or landscape. If the photos to be processed are already within
the bounding box resolution, they will be saved in the resized folder, but remain the original size.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE:

*Navigate to the directory containing the photo_resizer.exe executable. This can be found in the dist folder.

*Run the executable 'main.exe'.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow the prompts to enter the path of the directory containing the photos you want to resize. If you need help finding the directory path, type help for instructions.
The program will create a subdirectory named resized in the specified directory and save all resized images there.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS:

*Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder with the current work order's photos.

*Click the address bar to highlight the path. (Refer to ADDRESS BAR EXAMPLE if necessary)

*Copy the path and paste it into the program when prompted.

*The program will resize all .jpg files in the specified directory and save the resized images in the resized subdirectory.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:

*This program only processes .jpg and .jpeg files.

*The script resizes images to fit within a maximum size of 1600x1200 pixels while preserving the original aspect ratio. This ensures that the images are scaled down proportionally 
without distortion independent of orientation, fitting within the bounding box while maintaining their natural dimensions.

*If the resized subdirectory already exists, the program will use it without creating a new one.

EXIT:

To exit the program at any time, type exit when prompted.
